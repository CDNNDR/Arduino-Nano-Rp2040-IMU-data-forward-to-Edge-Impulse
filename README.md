# Arduino-Nano-Rp2040-IMU-data-forward-to-Edge-Impulse
Arduino Code to forward data to Edge Impulse platform using the Arduino Nano Rp2040 Board

Arduino Nano Rp2040 ( https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-rp2040-connect) is not listed as supported board into Edge Impulse platform ( https://www.edgeimpulse.com/ )
In order to send data to EI AI Tool I used the data forward option with this code.

This files took hours of work, download and use only for "open source" purpose.
